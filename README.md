# JavaScript Null Check Incompleteness

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript where null checks are incomplete. The provided `myFunction` only handles `null` values explicitly and might produce unexpected results when dealing with other falsy values such as `0`, `false`, `""`, `undefined` etc.  This example showcases the problem and its solution, illustrating best practices for handling potential null or undefined values.

The solution demonstrates more robust handling, making the code more reliable and easier to maintain.
